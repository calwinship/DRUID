        You are a funny high school math teacher, and today you are teaching Probability to. You must use accessible language and your messages should be short and regularly ask for confirmation that understands. Ask regular questions and be very careful when checking the student's answers. Today, you must provide a lesson with the following objectives: 
        - understand the fundamental principle of counting, from a theoretical and practical standpoint. this should be tested with an example of the fundamental principle of counting with restaurant menu choices, number of ways of arranging the letters of the student’s name, and another practical and useful example.
        - this should naturally lead onto factorials. get the student to use their calculator to do perform 2 calculations that require factorials. then ask them what they think 0 factorial is, and explain the answer once they provide theirs.

Question 1 
A circular spinner has 12 sectors, as follows: 
• 5 sectors are labelled €6
• 3 sectors are labelled €9
• The rest are labelled €0. 
In a game, the spinner is spun once. 
The spinner is equally likely to land on each sector. 
The player gets the amount of money shown on the sector 
that the spinner lands on. 
(a) Fiona plays the game a number of times. 
 Work out the probability that Fiona gets €6, then €9, then €6 the first three times she plays. 
Give your answer correct to 4 decimal places. 
(b) Rohan also plays the game a number of times. 
Find the probability that Rohan gets €9 for the 3rd time, on the 8th time that he plays the 
game. Give your answer correct to 4 decimal places.



(a)
Method 1: 
5+3𝑚 = 11 
3𝑚 = 6
𝑚 = 2 
5+3𝑚 = −11
3𝑚 = −16
𝑚 = -16/3
OR 
Method 2: 
(5+3𝑚)**2 = 11**2
25 + 30𝑚 + 9𝑚**2 = 121
9𝑚**2 + 30𝑚 − 96 = 0
3𝑚**2 + 10𝑚 − 32 = 0
(3𝑚 + 16)(𝑚−2) = 0
𝑚 = -16/3, 𝑚 = 2 

Scale 15 Marks (0, 4, 8, 12, 15) 
Method 1 
Low Partial Credit: 
• 1 linear equation. 
• One correct value of 𝑚 found 
without work. 
• Attempts at trial and 
improvement. 
Mid Partial Credit: 
• One value of 𝑚 found with 
work. 
High Partial Credit 
• One value of 𝑚 correctly found 
and work of merit in finding the 
second value. 
Method 2 
Note: If quadratic does not have an 𝑚
term award Mid Partial Credit at most 
Low Partial Credit: 
• Indication of squaring 
Mid Partial Credit: 
• relevant quadratic in m 
expanded (Line 2 of the 
solution) 
• Quadratic is missing the 𝑚 term, 
otherwise correct 
High Partial Credit 
• quadratic factorised 
• quadratic formula fully 
substituted 


(b) 
𝑗 + 𝑘 = ℎ𝑘
𝑘 − ℎ𝑘 = −𝑗
𝑘(1 − ℎ) = −𝑗
k = − j / (1 − ℎ)
or 
j / (h - 1)

Scale 10 Marks (0, 3, 5, 8, 10) 
Low Partial Credit: 
• Work of merit in eliminating 
fractions 
Mid Partial Credit 
• Terms with 𝑘 transposed to 
one side of the equation
High Partial Credit 
• 𝑘(1 − ℎ) = −𝑗 or equivalent 


(c) Olga plays the game 2 times. 
 Find the probability that Olga gets less than €16 in total from playing the game. 
Give your answer correct to 4 decimal places.
