# DRUID 

DRUID is an AI-powered personal tutor, specifically tailored for Leaving Cert Maths. 

The advent of LLMs offers transformative prospects for the realm of education, especially in personalising mathematics learning. This is a component of research into the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into tutoring systems for mathematics, emphasising their potential to tailor learning experiences to the individual needs, pace, and interests of students. It addresses the augmentation of LLMs with technologies such as knowledge graphs, tool-integrated reasoning agents, and advanced prompting methods to overcome issues like hallucinations and lack of robust personalisation.
